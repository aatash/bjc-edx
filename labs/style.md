# Lab Style Guidelines
These guidelines are here to help make labs more consistent and easier to
follow and update. Hopefully, these rules aren't too much of a burden.

### Using Block Images
All *built in* block images are included under "*./resources/bult-in-blocks*".
The files are organized by the label of block they are (Control, Operator, etc).
The files are PNGs at 125% block size. Each block follows it's name in *Snap!*
using spaces, but removing punctuation. Parameter inputs are included if there
is a default value. Built in variables are named using (). When referencing a
built-in block, you should **always** use one of these images. However, when
changing the inputs, you should create a new image and place it in the resources
for the appropriate lab.

Feel free to resize the images as necessary, but we are going to hopefully have
a standardized look.
